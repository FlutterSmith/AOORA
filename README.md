## SVG Editor description

I'M FINALLY DOING IT!!! My own SVG editor on web!!! Maybe I can make my own SVG editor without touching other's disgusting high-priced paid versions that are overrated.
I was inspired of Tatarstan, and the Blood Gem, and I thought this would be a great name.
However, the software is long from finished, and there are NO SVG yet. I am only working on the HTML canvas GUI, and it IS REALLY HARD!!!
This is the most "infamous" problem for me, because I've been creating a GUI for more than Â½ a year now, but this is worse. I would like say good luck to my future software, and maybe one day I would see myself working on an artwork using MY OWN MINDBLOWING SOFTWARE, how good isn't that.
The worst thing troubling me are the complicated algorithm that bends my mind, giving me permenant migraine. But one day I believe I can make it, and survive the hardest construction I ever had made in my entire life.
